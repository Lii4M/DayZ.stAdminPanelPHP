(I currently cannot test the steps due to maintenance on Zymic)\r\nNext, you will need an FTP client. I recommend CoffeeCup (http://www.coffeecup.com/free-ftp/) due to it being super-simple yet effective.\r\nDownload and install it.\r\n\r\n3: Editing config.php\r\n---------------------\r\nNow you should download this git and extract it to a local folder.\r\nOpen the config.php file with a text editor of your choice. I recommend Notepad++.\r\nHere's what you need to edit: (You can find this information in the dayz.st control panel)\r\n- Line 4: $DB_CONNSTRING (2nd one): The database host:port. If you host with dayz.st this should be db.dayz.st:3306\r\n- Line 6: $DB_CONNSTRING (4th one): The database name. This is probably the same as the database username. For dayz.st: bliss_**** where **** is a number.\r\n- Line 7: $DB_USERNAME: The database username. Probably the same as the database name.\r\n- Line 8: $DB_PASSWORD: The database password\r\n- Line 9: $ST_PASSWORD: Your dayz.st password\r\n- Line 11: define(\"URLVARS\", \"u=dayzstuser&p=dayzstpasswordhash\");\r\nGo to your control panel and click the minimap. A new browser tab should open.\r\nIn the new browser tab, copy the part of the url after http://dayz.st/map?****** where ****** is what you need to copy.\r\nIt should be in the format of u=***&p=***.\r\nNow replace u=dayzstuser&p=dayzstpasswordhash on line 11 with what you just copied.\r\n- Line 13: $users\r\nHere you can specify multiple users.\r\nThe default user's username and password are \"admin\".\r\nTo change the username, replace the first word (admin) with a new username.\r\nTo change the password, go to http://md5encryption.com/ and enter the password you want to use, encrypt it, and then copy the hash to the second part.\r\nTo have multiple users, make a new line with the same format as the first line, but different values.\r\nFor multiple users, every user except the last one should have a comma (,) at the end of the line.\r\n\r\n4: Uploading to the webhost\r\n---------------------------\r\nOpen up your FTP program.\r\nAdd a new server. For CoffeeCup FTP:\r\n- Click on servers.\r\n- Click on the green plus.\r\n- Enter a nickname for the server.\r\n- Enter the server host, username and password.\r\n- Connect.\r\n- Navigate to where you want to upload the website (Can be a folder called htdocs, public_html, or something else, depending on your webhost).\r\n- Upload everything.\r\n- Navigate to the correct URL in your browser.\r\n- Profit.\r\n\r\nTroubleshooting\r\n===============\r\nIf you get an error like the following:\r\n- Fatal error: Uncaught exception 'PDOException' with message 'SQLSTATE[HY000] [2005] Unknown MySQL server host 'db.dayz.st:1111' (3)' in /public_html/admin/index.php:10 Stack trace: #0 /home/a9156499/public_html/admin/index.php(10): PDO->__construct('mysql:host=db.d...', 'bliss_111', '11111111') #1 {main} thrown in /public_html/admin/index.php on line 10\r\n\r\nTry removing :port from the $DB_CONNSTRING on line 4 in config.php and reuploading it.\r\n\r\nIf there are any more problems, please contact me on skype (swaxtraxx) or email (rubencoolen@live.be).\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
